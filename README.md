# What
Wa, Wa waaa Waluigi? wasm?. Web developer? Not quite... C in hiding? Maybe.


## Not actually web dev

Wasync, for WebAssembly and Sync. Sync what you may ask? Well as it turns out I have made a few small games in C... This organization is only here to host their slightly modified versions  that have been compiled to WASM so they can work on the web :)

If you expected some wasm trickery and magickery well, sorry to disappoint, but fear not, you can play above mentionned games here : .

## Cower, mortals, for C is everywhere.
